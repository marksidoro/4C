    /// Internal artery implementation
    /*!
      This internal class keeps all the working arrays needed to
      calculate the artery element. Additionally, the method Sysmat()
      provides a clean and fast element implementation.

      <h3>Purpose</h3>

      The idea is to separate the element maintenance (class Artery) from the
      mathematical contents (this class). There are different
      implementations of the artery element, this is just one such
      implementation.

      The artery element will allocate exactly one object of this class for all
      artery elements with the same number of nodes in the mesh. This
      allows us to use exactly matching working arrays (and keep them
      around.)

      The code is meant to be as clean as possible. This is the only way
      to keep it fast. The number of working arrays has to be reduced to
      a minimum so that the element fits into the cache. (There might be
      room for improvements.)

      <h3>Usability</h3>

      The calculations are done by the Evaluate ... () methods which are
      inherited from the ArteryEleInterface.
